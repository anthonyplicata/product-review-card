## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Josh Comeau CSS Reset

### What I learned

I learned to create a responsive webpage for mobile and desktop using flexbox and grid. Using <picture> is a great tool to add multiple img files that can be used for different screen sizes. I learned better ways of organizing elements too.

This challenge tested me quite a bit with figuring out how to make it responsive. I realize that vertical and horizontal card are the same and it depends on the width of the screen and the max-width you set. I spent quite a bit of time trying to make two separate "cubes" to put next to each other, but I learned quickly they did not maintain interaction how I intended.


### Continued development

I'm still struggling with bringing the contents into the center of the page. For the last challenge I was given helpful advice of removing padding and margin to utilize the flexbox potential. It worked for that one, but for this challenge I could not figure it out.

I would love some advice on that.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - I struggled a lot with this, but this video outlined a lot of mistakes I was making. I definitely do not take credit for accomplishing this challenge becuase I used this video. However, I learned a lot from it.
